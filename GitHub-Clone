Using Emacs/Magit:
-----------------

1) Navigate to empty folder.

2) Run magit-clone: M-x ^m cl

3) Clone from [u]rl or name, [p]ath, or [l]ocal url: enter 'u'

4) Clone from url or name: paste repo SSH (git@github.com:daveswaves/laravel_adam_david.git)

5) Navigate to correct location.

6) Set `remote.pushDefault' to "origin"? (y or n): y


Running composer install:
------------------------

In a terminal, navigate to the above folder and run composer install: $ composer install


Install NPM dependencies (optional):
-----------------------------------

PHP code is installed via composer install.

To install Javascript (or Node) packages (eg. Vue.js, Bootstrap.css, Lodash, Laravel Mix etc), run: $ npm install


Finally, set up the .env file. Copy .env.example to .env (cp .env.example .env) and add the required database name: 'DB_DATABASE=db_name'

*** To avoid a 'No application encryption key has been specified.' error being displayed the
.env file will also need an APP_KEY=base64:app_key (the app key is typically 44 characters)


Server Address already in Use error:
-----------------------------------

Occasionally, running $ php artisan serve will return the following message:

WARN  Failed to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 (reason: Address already in use).
INFO  Server running on [http://127.0.0.1:8001].

Press Ctrl+C to stop the server

The server has ended up running in the background with no way of pressing Ctrl+C.

Run the following to find the PID running port 8000: $ lsof -i :8000

Eg.

php8.1  18226 david    6u  IPv4 115269      0t0  TCP localhost:8000 (LISTEN)

The following will stop the server:
$ sudo kill -9 18226
